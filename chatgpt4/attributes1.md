Prompt: Hello can you give me an extensive list of human attributes, organism attributes (excluding aforementioned humans), object attributes (these are human/organism made), environment attributes (environment in physical sense, not social/cultural/racial/ect.; should exclude attributes of aforementioned objects). This list should be reflecting only morphological, physiological, geographic and physical aspects. 

Then do the same list with psychological, behavioral and ecological aspects. Second list should reflect things such as culture, religion, technology, ect.

1. Morphological, Physiological, Geographic, and Physical Aspects

Human Attributes:
Morphological:
Height, weight, body shape, skin color, hair texture, eye color, fingerprints.
Physiological:
Heart rate, metabolism, blood pressure, muscle strength, sensory acuity.
Geographic:
Location, climate adaptability, elevation tolerance.
Physical:
Heat tolerance, hydration needs, bone density, fat composition.
Organism Attributes (Excluding Humans):
Morphological:
Body size, appendages (e.g., wings, fins), coloration, exoskeleton presence.
Physiological:
Reproductive cycles, thermoregulation (e.g., endothermic, ectothermic), photosynthesis capacity.
Geographic:
Habitat range, migration patterns, altitudinal adaptability.
Physical:
Mass, density, mobility (e.g., flight, swimming).
Object Attributes (Human/Organism Made):
Morphological:
Shape, dimensions, material composition, symmetry.
Physiological (Functionality):
Durability, flexibility, load capacity, thermal conductivity.
Geographic (Usage or Placement):
Location dependency (e.g., urban infrastructure), portability.
Physical:
Weight, texture, reflectivity, density, electrical properties.
Environment Attributes (Excluding Objects):
Morphological:
Landforms (mountains, valleys), water bodies (rivers, lakes), soil types.
Physiological (Processes):
Weather systems, erosion, volcanic activity, nutrient cycling.
Geographic:
Latitude, longitude, elevation, climatic zones.
Physical:
Temperature, humidity, air pressure, light intensity, wind patterns.

2. Psychological, Behavioral, and Ecological Aspects

Human Attributes:
Psychological:
Emotions, intelligence, memory, creativity, stress responses.
Behavioral:
Social interactions, habits, learning, communication styles.
Ecological:
Resource use, waste production, urbanization impact, cultural rituals.
Organism Attributes (Excluding Humans):
Psychological:
Sensory perception, instincts, cognitive abilities (e.g., problem-solving in primates).
Behavioral:
Mating rituals, foraging behavior, social structures (e.g., herds, colonies).
Ecological:
Niche roles, predator-prey dynamics, symbiosis, migration.
Object Attributes (Human/Organism Made):
Psychological (Representation):
Symbolic meaning, aesthetics, cultural significance.
Behavioral (Use):
Functionality in context, interaction frequency, wear patterns.
Ecological:
Energy consumption, recyclability, pollution impact, obsolescence.
Environment Attributes:
Psychological (Perception):
Beauty, sense of place, inspiration.
Behavioral (Interaction):
Human modification (e.g., agriculture), animal habitat usage.
Ecological:
Biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate influence, energy flows.
