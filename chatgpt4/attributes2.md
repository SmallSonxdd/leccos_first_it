Prompt: Alright, can you redo the two lists but without given set of what kinds of attributes to focus on? Brainstorm, come up your own kinds of attributes, this was just an outline I want you to follow and give me your best, figure out things I have forgotten. The reason for splitting the list is one portrays the worldly/physical, the second portrays abstract/mental. Add a third list portraying metaphysical/esoteric/otherworldly.

Mechanical: Joint flexibility, gait, endurance, reaction time.
Organisms:
Structural: Root systems, feather patterns, shell composition, scale configuration.
Physiological: Growth rate, thermal adaptability, digestive efficiency, photosynthesis output.
Sensory: Echolocation, thermoreception, magnetoreception, vibrational detection.
Reproductive: Gestation periods, pollination mechanisms, spawning behaviors.
Objects:
Material: Hardness, elasticity, corrosion resistance, surface friction.
Functional: Power efficiency, load distribution, wear rate, modularity.
Aesthetic: Color palette, gloss, pattern symmetry, material texture.
Dimensional: Length, width, depth, volume, density.
Environment:
